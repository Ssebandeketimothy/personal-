<hr>
<p style="background-color: lightyellow;" style="font-size: 200;">Farming involves rearing of animals and crop cultivation; it is an important part of agriculture. Farmers aim at providing enough, healthy food to feed the ever-increasing population worldwide. Different types of farming practices are practised in different regions across the world based on various factors. Agriculture is the art and science of cultivating the soil, growing crops and raising livestock. It includes the preparation of plant</p>

<img src="images 1..jpg" alt="" height="400" width="500">
<li>For me i have an experience of 5years in farming and i have seen that agriculture is becoming an exact science. It is a never-ending science, with many angles that open up avenues leading in all directions. The successful farmer still needs to have a love of the land, and practical experience, and plenty of courage and determination; but in addition he now needs a thorough grounding in the science of his calling. In the future this will be even more true.”

    To be successful, a farmer must know a great deal about his land and the products he plans to raise.
    
    Every plant and animal is a complicated organism. He who wishes to succeed in the culture of wheat, rye, corn, tobacco, or cotton, for example, must be thoroughly familiar with the characteristics of the plant, its germination and growth, the diseases and blights to which it is susceptible, and the methods of controlling them.
    
    The dairy farmer and rancher must be acquainted with the characteristics of his cattle; their feed requirements, their breeding habits, and their common illnesses. Likewise, fruit farming requires expert knowledge of tree growth as well as grafting, pruning, spraying, and fertilizing.</li>
    <h1 style="background-color: lightsalmon;"><marquee>HOW DO I SELECT A FARM</marquee></h1>
    <img src="images2..png" alt="" height="400" width="600">
    <p style="background-color: lightpink;">After i carefully weigh the pros and cons yields, and the type of livestock that will thrive in the region. Some of the climatic factors to be considered are the amount and distribution of rainfall during the year, length of the growing season, severity of the winters, and the possibility of such natural hazards as drought, flood, hailstorms, windstorms, and the like. </li>

    <h1 style="background-color: LIGHTSALMON;"><marquee>QUESTIONS THAT I CONSIDER WHEN FARMING</marquee></h1>
    <li>Is Climate a key factor in determining the kinds of crops that can be grown, crf farming versus other occupations and deciding in favor of the former, then there am ready to consider the questions: Shall i buy or rent a farm? Where shall i farm? What kind of farming shall i undertake? that how i made it</p>.
        <img src="cli.jpg" alt="" height="400" width="600">
    <li>Good soil is perhaps the most essential element in farming since it determines not only what can be grown but whether yields will be high or low.</li>
    <img src="soi.jpg" alt="" height="400" width="600"><img src="soi2.jpg" alt="" height="400" width="600">
    <li>The size of the farm is naturally a major consideration. Half the nations 6 million farms produce very little for sale—in fact, only about 10 per cent of the total commercial produce. Before the war, many of the small farms, especially in such areas as the southern Appalachians, had more manpower than was needed</li>
    <img src="siz.jpg" alt="" height="400" width="600">
    <li>There are other factors to consider in choosing a farm, such as, are good roads available to haul the produce to market?</li>
    <li>Finally,i olso consider the community advantages. A farm is a home as well as a business. A neighborhood with good schools, active churches, and social organizations such as lodges and farmer’s clubs is likely to be a place where farmers are fairly successful. A region with poor schools and backward community organizations is apt to have poor and struggling farmers.</li>
